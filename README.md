**Manually-Controlled-Trash-Collecting-Bot :**



We built manually controlled trash collecting bot for trash collection and segregation. The bot can be controlled through the blynk app interface and collect waste using the arm and it has a storage compartment and segregate waste into metal and non metal. Our goal is to reduce human interaction with hazardous wastes.
